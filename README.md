# VBA_Challenge
## Overview of Project
	The purpose of this project was to analyze several green stock options for a client. The client’s parents have invested in the DQ stock and the client wants to know if this is the best stock out of a total of 12 potential green stock options. This project was to be completed using VBA code analyzing Excel data. Initially the data was analyzed, but this challenge required that the code be refactored to run more efficiently. 
## Results
	The analysis shows that the DQ stock returned a value of +199.4% in 2017, the highest off all of the 12 stock options as seen in All Stocks (2017) ![All Stocks (2017)](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/blob/main/All%20Stocks%20(2017).png). However, in 2018 DQ returned a value of -62.6% as seen in All Stocks (2018) ![All Stocks (2018)](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/blob/main/All Stocks (2018).png). The code for these results can be found in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm file for further review. 
## Summary
Many of the stocks appear to varied drastically, going from positive to negative from 2017 to 2018. However, the highest performing stock over both years was ENPH (2017: +129.5%, 2018: 81.9%) followed by RUN (2017: +5.5%, 2018: +84%). The client’s parents might consider investing is a more stable option such as ENPH, as it was the highest performer over both years, over DQ if they would like to consider only the 12 green stock investment options researched by their son. 
###Advantages and Disadvantages to general refactoring in general 
	Refactoring has the advantage of ensuring that the code running is the most efficient it can be for a wide variety of data input. The disadvantage of refactoring is only the time that it takes to complete. While the ideal is always to write the most efficient code possible on the first try, this simply isn’t always possible. When necessary, it is always wise to rethink and refactor code to optimum efficiency. 
###Advantages and Disadvantages to the original and refactored code. 
This code is a great example of when refactoring is most efficient. The run time between the original code and the refactored code is dramatic! This can be seen when comparing the original run time over the 2017 code ![All Stocks (2017) ORIGINAL](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/Resources/All Stocks (2017) ORIGINAL.png) and 2018 code ![All Stocks (2018) ORIGINAL](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/Resources/All Stocks (2018) ORIGINAL.png) and the refactored code for 2017 ![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) and 2018 ![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/VBA_Challenge/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png). This means that if the client chose to consider larger data sets to run this code over, the refactored code would be much faster than the original code.
